# WIN-MT

**Windows My Tools**, a small program that I made to apply some tweaks to a Windows Installation.   

> It **ONLY WORKS** works for **Windows 10 LTSC (1809) Build**.

:warning: **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK â€‹**:warning:

### What it does

- Disable a list of services, that I have no need for
- Disable some Tasks, that I have no need for
- Apply some Group Policy values
- Applies some other tweaks

The purpose is to make the Windows system a bit lighter by disabling things that I do not use.

**Can also** 

- Enable a set of services, like a group of them, you can declare multiple service groups, this is helpful if you want to enable/disable functionalities on the fly, like networking.
- Display information on services

### Excuse the Barebones Readme

Perhaps I'll make a decent Readme one day

### Infos

Running on **nodejs**, build with **HAXE**.
